# Todo-list-odin-project

### This is for now hardest project i ever made, i see many unnecessary lines of code, but i will start to make it more readable when i complete it

## For few days i took rest from this project and was learning something else and designing pages, i will return and try to rewrite whole id logic because for now it looks terrible and is in some way broken, i not change how website is build, but how logic behind it works
